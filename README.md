# Protein-Secondary-Structure-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

The probabilistic capabilities of the logistic regression sigmoid, and then the clustering of k-means to ob-tain secondary structure information. This project primarily introduces the method as a way to use commonly known and efficient algorithms to compute and determine the secondary structure of the protein given its amino acid sequence. First the amino acids were passed through the logistic regression sigmoid, then combined with the k-means clustering algorithm. Overall, the final results looked promising for less proteins with similar secondary structures. However, once variety in size, sequence, and structure was introduced, the method’s accuracy drastically decreased from 84% to about 42%. This decrease is discussed in detail, but overall, a slight miscalculation in the logistic regression attributes to this. Overall, this combination of algorithms helps identify a protein’s secondary structure relatively accurately.
